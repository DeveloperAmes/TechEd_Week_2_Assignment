# TechEd_Week_2_Assignment

Building an accessible image gallery as part of the TechEducators software development bootcamp

What requirements did you achieve?

Were there any goals that you were unable to achieve?

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Additional reflections:
Again, I used my own images rather than downloading them from another site.

Found it very difficult to display the main image on click and Bertie explained to me that it was because I was trying to access the [i] from inside a scope I couldn't access.

I really struggled with trying to figure out the dimensions for the main image, and if using a max-width of 100%, the image would not center inside of the grid (horizontally) even though I tried all of the "align", "justify" "place" etc on both of the image itself and the container. I really would like some feedback on this for the future as I spent an hour just trying to do this. There is also a large blank space underneath the image when I change it to a "mobile" viewport and the scrollbar - I can't figure out why that is there when I have set the two sections to fill the viewport height of the screen and it seems to fit nicely.
